# naquadah

v0.1

A minetest mod that adds Naquadah from Stargate

(WIP)

Firstly, this is a going to be pretty rough, as I am learning lua and minetest
modding as I go along.  Don't expect it to work to well at first.

This mod will add naquadah to minetest, and a few items to go with it.

Planned items:
	Tokra crystals - create specific shape and size rooms
	Naquadah generator - portable short-term use generator
